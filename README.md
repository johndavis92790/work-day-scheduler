# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This challenge taught me a few things. I learned that Moment.js does not work well with some browsers currently so I was able to convert my functions to Day.js and get that to work. Its very similar and I didn't have to change much to get my main functions to work. Mush easier to work with and the documentation is much easier to read and follow. I was able to use both Bootstrap and the custom css included in the starter files.
